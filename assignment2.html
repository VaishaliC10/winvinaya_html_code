<p>William Blake (28 November 1752-12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and
    printmaker. Largely Unreconised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in
    the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic
    works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its
    merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-
    century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever
    produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest
    Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,
    [5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the
    imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".</p>
